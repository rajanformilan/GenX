        <b>GenX</b>, short for <b>Generation X</b>, refers to the demographic cohort born between the early 1990s and the early 2000s, typically between 1995 and 1997, although the exact range can vary slightly depending on the source. This generation is often seen as the bridge between the Baby Boomers and the Millennials.
<br>
GenX grew up during a time of shifting societal norms, economic challenges, and technological advancements. They witnessed the rise of personal computers, the internet, and the early stages of digital media, yet they also experienced life before the pervasive influence of the internet. This unique position has made them highly adaptable, with a strong mix of traditional and modern values.
<br>
Gen Xers are often characterized by their independence, resourcefulness, and skepticism. Many were raised by working parents and experienced a more hands-off, self-reliant upbringing. They are sometimes referred to as the "latchkey generation" because of the high number of children who came home to empty houses after school due to both parents working.
<br>
In terms of cultural influence, GenX contributed significantly to music, entertainment, and technology. They were at the forefront of the grunge and hip-hop movements, the rise of video games, and the development of the internet as a mainstream medium.
<br>
Despite often being overshadowed by the larger Baby Boomer and Millennial generations, GenX has played a crucial role in shaping the modern world and continues to be a vital force in the workforce and beyond.
